# Gramby's Workshop.
Gramby's workshop is a builder or editor for the roblox game "Road to Gramby's" by [Mumble Games](https://www.roblox.com/groups/4785134/Mumble-Games#), it's purpose is to make building far easier.

I reccomend you to join the road to gramby's discord server if you're going to build in here at [its discord](https://discord.gg/TGssyV6aQT), or you can join the [gramby workshop discord](https://discord.gg/RCtQGbb5) instead if you want to focus on the program's communnity instead.
